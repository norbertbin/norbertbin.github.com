## Setting Up Amazon EC2
This is a very basic overview of how to get up and running on a single Amazon
EC2 instance. 
 
### Setting Up Account
- Create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. Free tier accounts are available.
- Under "Network and Security", select "Key Pairs." Click "Create Key Pair" and
save the generated key in a convenient directory. 

### Launching an Instance
- Go to the EC2 Dashboard and click "Launch Instance."
- Choose the AMI (Amazon Machine Image) Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (HVM).
- Choose instance type t2.micro for setup purposes. If you need to you will be
able to transfer your setup to a more powerful instance later. 
- Tag the instance. Here you need to create a meaningful key-value pair(s). 
This is how you can keep track of the various instances you might create.
- Create security group. Most of the defaults here are fine for know. One thing
you might want to change is the "source" to MyIP, so requests from all other 
addresses will be blocked.

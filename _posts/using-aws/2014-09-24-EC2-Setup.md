## Setting Up Amazon EC2
This is a very basic overview of how to get up and running on a single Amazon
EC2 instance from a Linux machine. 
 
### Setting Up an AWS Account
- Create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. Free tier accounts are 
available.
- Under "Network and Security", select "Key Pairs." Click "Create Key Pair" and
save the generated key in a convenient directory. 
- Ensure the key is not publicly viewable using the following bash command.
{% highlight bash %}
chmod 400 key-file.pem
{% endhighlight %}

### Launching an Instance
- Go to the EC2 Dashboard and click "Launch Instance."
- Select the AMI (Amazon Machine Image) Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (HVM).
- Select instance type "t2.micro" for setup purposes. If needed, you can 
transfer your setup to a more powerful instance later. 
- Keep the default settings in the "Configure Instance" and "Add Storage" steps.
- Tag the instance by creating a meaningful key-value pair(s). 
This is how you can keep track of the various instances you create.
- Create a security group. Most of the defaults here are fine for now. 
One thing you should change to enhance security is the "Source" to 
MyIP. This ensures that requests to the instance from all other ip addresses 
will be blocked.  
- Review the setting and launch the instance.

### Connecting to the Instance
- In the EC2 Dashboard under "Instances" select your instance. The public DNS
address will now be displayed along with other instance details. The address
will be used to connect to the instance and should have the form
 *ec2-id.compute.amazonaws.com*.
- Use **ssh** in the directory with the generated key file to connect to 
the instance with the public DNS address. 
{% highlight bash %}
ssh -i key-file.pem ubuntu@ec2-id.compute.amazonaws.com
{% endhighlight %}

### Create a User 
- Once connected to the instance you can execute the following commands to 
to create a new user and a user directory.
{% highlight bash %}
sudo useradd username
sudo mkdir /home/username
sudo passwd username
sudo chmod -R 0777 /home/username
{% endhighlight %}

### Installing Some Essentials
- First make sure everything is up to date.
{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
{% endhighlight %}
- Install Emacs or favorite text editor.
{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install emacs24
{% endhighlight %} 
- Add a CRAN mirror to the sources.list file.
{% highlight bash %}
emacs /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sources.list
{% endhighlight %}
- Add the following text to the file. This specifies which CRAN
mirror should be used to download R and R packages.
{% highlight bash %}
deb http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/bin/linux/ubuntu precise/
{% endhighlight %}
- Re-run updates. This might give some errors which is fine.
{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get update
{% endhighlight %}
- Install R.
{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install r-base
{% endhighlight %}

### Uploading Data and Other Files
- Use **scp** to transfer any files to the instance.  
{% highlight bash %}
scp -i key-file.pem upload_file ubuntu@ec2-id.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/username
{% endhighlight %}
